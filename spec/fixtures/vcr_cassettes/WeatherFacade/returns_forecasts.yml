        Effect**\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n-
        A Storm Surge Watch and Tropical Storm Watch have been issued for\nCoastal
        Collier\n- A Storm Surge Watch has been issued for Far South Miami-Dade,\nInland
        Collier, and Mainland Monroe\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Storm Surge
        Watch and Tropical Storm Watch are in effect for\nCoastal Collier\n- A Storm
        Surge Watch is in effect for Far South Miami-Dade,\nInland Collier, and Mainland
        Monroe\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 610 miles south of Naples FL or about
        600 miles south of\nMarco Island FL\n- 17.3N 81.4W\n- Storm Intensity 65 mph\n-
        Movement Northwest or 315 degrees at 13 mph\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\nTropical
        Storm Ian is presently located in the Caribbean Sea. This\nsystem is forecast
        to intensify into a hurricane at some point Monday\nupon approaching the Yucatan
        Channel, and may strengthen into a major\nhurricane upon approaching the eastern
        Gulf of Mexico waters by\nTuesday. While a direct landfall to South Florida
        is unlikely at this\ntime, hazardous conditions can extend well away from
        the center of the\nsystem. and these are the possible impacts for South Florida:\n*
        Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall associated with rainbands may lead\nto flooding
        across all of South Florida. Rainfall totals may range of\n4 to 6 inches through
        Wednesday with locally higher amounts possible\nand the risk could extend
        later into the week. This may result in\nmoderate/considerable flooding impacts.\n*
        Peak storm surge values of 3 to 5 feet are a concern across\nSouthwest Florida
        mainly between Tuesday night and Wednesday night\nprimarily.\n* Tornadoes
        may be embedded in showers and thunderstorms within the\nouter rainbands associated
        with the system. Main concern is Tuesday\ninto Wednesday.\n* Hazardous marine
        and beach conditions are expected with a high risk\nfor rip currents across
        all South Florida beaches. Elevated surf\nconditions are likely along the
        Gulf coast.\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n* SURGE:\nPrepare for life-threatening
        surge having possible significant\nimpacts across the Southwest Florida coast.
        Potential impacts in\nthis area include:\n- Areas of inundation with storm
        surge flooding accentuated by\nwaves. Damage to several buildings, mainly
        near the coast.\n- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads
        become\nweakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low\nspots.\n-
        Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and\nnumerous
        rip currents.\n- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.\nSeveral
        small craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages.\nAlso,
        prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited\nimpacts across
        the coast of Florida Bay.\nElsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact
        is anticipated.\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for dangerous rainfall flooding
        having possible significant\nimpacts across South Florida. Potential impacts
        include:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n-
        Ditches and canals may quickly become swollen with swift\ncurrents and overspill
        their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots.\n- Flood
        waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may
        experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots,
        and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water
        as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome
        hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n* WIND:\nPrepare for dangerous
        wind having possible significant impacts across\ncoastal Collier. Potential
        impacts in this area include:\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials,
        along with damage\nto porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few buildings\nexperiencing
        window, door, and garage door failures. Mobile\nhomes damaged, especially
        if unanchored. Unsecured lightweight\nobjects become dangerous projectiles.\n-
        Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places
        where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n-
        Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily
        wooded places. A few bridges, causeways, and access\nroutes impassable.\n-
        Scattered power and communications outages, but more prevalent\nin areas with
        above ground lines.\nAlso, prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited
        impacts\nacross the rest of South Florida.\n* TORNADOES:\nPrepare for a tornado
        event having possible limited impacts across\nSouth Florida. Potential impacts
        include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof
        emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado
        damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could
        realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile\nhomes pushed off foundations or
        overturned, large tree tops and\nbranches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees
        knocked over, moving\nvehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from
        moorings.\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\n----------------------------------\n*
        EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,
        including\npossible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.\n*
        OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions,
        do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain,
        damaging\nwind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the\ncenter
        of the storm.\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on
        appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency
        plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information
        see redcross.org\nNEXT UPDATE\n-----------\nThe next local statement will
        be issued by the National Weather\nService in Miami FL around 5 AM EDT, or
        sooner if conditions warrant.","tags":["Wind"]}]}'
