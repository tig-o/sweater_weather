        following areas,\nCoastal Broward, Coastal Collier, Coastal Miami-Dade, Coastal
        Palm\nBeach, Far South Miami-Dade, Glades, Hendry, Inland Broward,\nInland

        IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,\ncreeks, streams,
        and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.\nFlooding may occur in poor
        drainage and urban areas.\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- Hurricane Ian is forecast
        by NHC to move northward through\nthe\nSoutheastern Gulf Of Mexico through
        Wednesday. This will\nallow for\nthe PWAT values to increase from 2.2 inches
        this afternoon to\n2.3 to\n2.5 inches on Tuesday and remain in the 2.2 to
        2.4 inch range\non\nWednesday. These PWAT values are near the maximum values
        for\nthis\ntime of year. This means that South Florida will see the\npotential
        for heavy rainfall this afternoon through at least\nWednesday night.\nForecast
        rainfall amounts will generally range from 4 to 6\ninches\nacross the region
        from Hurricane Ian. There could be isolated\namounts of up 10 inches where
        repeated rounds of heavy\nrainfall\noccur. These rainfall amounts will be
        capable of producing\nflooding\nconditions due to the grounds being already
        saturated from\nthe daily\nheavy rainfall that has been occurring over South
        Florida the\nlast\nseveral days. WPC has also put the metro areas of South\nFlorida
        in a\nModerate Risk of Flooding with the interior areas of South\nFlorida\nin
        a Slight Risk of Flooding for Tuesday. Most areas will\nremain in\na slight
        risk of excessive rainfall on Wednesday. The\nexception to\nthis will be over
        southern areas, where a marginal risk will\nremain\nin place. Therefore, a
        Flood Watch has been issued for all of\nSouth\nFlorida through Thursday morning.\n-
